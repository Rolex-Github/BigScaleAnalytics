# Elastic Cloud

This week, you will learn about Elastic Cloud, a platform which enables search and analytics for both structured and unstructured data.

If you want to broaden your knowledge beyond this lab, the Elastic website provides many [video tutorials](https://www.elastic.co/videos/).

## Goals

* Become aware of the various components of the Elastic stack and their respective roles
* Explore the Kibana dashboard, the web interface that allows you to explore your data
* Get acquainted with the Query DSL search syntax in Elastic Search
* Leverage Elasticsearch's "Edge n-gram" tokenizer to create an autocompletion functionality

## Lab Structure

1. Create a free 2 week account, no credit card required on www.elastic.co/
2. Elastic Cloud walkthrough: Elastic Search and Kibana
3. Introducion to query DSL using the Kibana Dev Tools Console
4. Connecting your colab notebook to Elastic Cloud and using the elasticsearch-dsl package
5. Create an autocomplete functionality for your index using the Edge n-gram tokenizer in the Kibana Dev Tools Console
6. Create a deployment with the data for your personal assignment, part 4

If you are unsure how to make your queries, the [Query DSL documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl.html) has everything, including examples.
